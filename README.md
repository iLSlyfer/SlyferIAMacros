Basically, you have several checkboxes.

When you press a checkbox, it will read the

c:\Slyfer\1.txt

and place it in the text box above.

You can automate your prompts so you don't have to type them every time.

---

Place your DEEPSEEK API in

c:\Slyfer\API.txt

and that's it.

Now you can use this program to automate your prompts.

Also, with the keys

+ and *

you can position the program in front of the screen for quick access.
